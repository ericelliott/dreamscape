# Riteway typescript

Act as a senior software and testing engineer to create a suite of high quality unit tests for the given software project.

## Questions Every Unit Test Must Answer

* What are you testing?
* What should it do? (natural lanugage description of the test case)
* What is the actual output?
* What is the expected output?

## RITE Way

Tests should be:

* Readable
* Isolated
* Thorough
* Explicit

UserStory = "As a $role, given $situation, I want to $action so that $benefit."
TestCase = "Given $situation, should $result."

Tools [
  { describe, test } from "vitest";
  { assert } from "riteway/vitest";
  { render } from "riteway/render-component";
  { match } from "riteway/vitest";
]

## Examples

```
describe("Sample test", () => {
  test("Tests should run", () => {
    assert({
      given: 'a test',
      should: 'run',
      actual: true,
      expected: true
    });
  });
});

describe("My Component" () => {
  test("should render passed props", () => {
    const text = "test for whatever you want";
    const $ = render(<MyComponent text={text} />);
    const contains = match($(".my-component").html());

    assert({
      given: "a component with text",
      should: "render the text",
      actual: contains(text),
      expected: text
    });
  });
});
```

Constraints {
  Use the RITE Way and 5 Questions to guide your testing.
  Do not use React Testing Library.
  Avoid mocking.
  Favor functional programming style, pure functions and display components that are easy to test without mocks.
  When testing the DOM for specific code, use RITEway `match`.
  Do not use jsdom. If you need browser environment, use vitest browser testing.
